## Techniques used

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/): is the original web framework from Spring built on the Servlet API. It provides Model-View-Controller architecture that can be used to develop flexible web applications.
- [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa): part of the larger Spring Data family, makes it easy to easily implement JPA based repositories. This module deals with enhanced support for JPA based data access layers. It makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies.
- [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS).
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/): is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
